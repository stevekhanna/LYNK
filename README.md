# LYNK: A way to connect students, parents, and teachers to each other.

**Our project is a web-based school management system that connects students, parents and teachers, eliminating the need of paper consent forms and agendas. It allows for a deeper connection to the parent and teacher such as being able to see feedback and give feedback to the teacher.**

**This is a hackathon project using pycharm and django. We had 24 hours come up with a project from scratch and present it to judges.**

**Contributors: Issack John, Steve Khanna, Daniel Nwaroh, Jacob Hazen, and Montek Parmar**

**Tools & Environments:** We used Python,CSS,HTML, and Javascript, also using databases.
We worked off of 2 main computers, working on backend and frontend.
